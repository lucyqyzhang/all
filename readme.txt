Project Description:

Prix Predictor, is a stock market simulator and predictor 2 in 1. The user will be able to search up any stocks, with prices in real-time, and using Monte Carlo methods, the application will be able to generate an estimate of the specific stock price in the future. In addition, the user will be able to join a stock investment game, where they will be able to compete with other users, and be given a beginning amount of money, which they will then “invest” in the real-time stock market and see who can make the most profit.
